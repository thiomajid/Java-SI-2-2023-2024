# Course materials for Java programming 2023-2024 (L2)

This repository contains corrections for all exercises that will be given during this semester. The repository is organized as follows:

- `exercises`: contains the exercises that will be given during the semester. Each exercice is written in its own markdown file (`.md` extension), and contains the description of the exercise, as well as the instructions to follow to complete it. You'll also find exercises in _pdf_ format in the _exports_ folder.

- `corrections`: Except for the exercises folder, every other folder contains the correction of its corresponding TP.

PS: You'll can also find exercises in _pdf_ format at [this address](https://rb.gy/542cn)
